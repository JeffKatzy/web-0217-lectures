# We want to add the following methods to each of the classes
# An all method, where each object is added upon initialization of the object
# A find_by_name method for both the customer and the restaurant


# If you are not sketching out your domain, and thinking about single source of truth,
# you are doing it wrong :(

  # Customer.find_by_name(name) - DONE
  # Customer#add_review - DONE
  # Customer#add_restaurant -DONE
